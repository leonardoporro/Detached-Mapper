## Issues and feedback
Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/leonardoporro/Detached-Mapper/issues) tab to report anything you find using the library.
All feedback is welcome, I'll try to prioritize and fix everything, but I have limited personal time to work on this.

## Changes & Breaking Changes
Please take a look at the new list [here](https://github.com/leonardoporro/Detached-Mapper/wiki/Changes-&-Breaking-Changes).

## PR your test!
Fork the project and send me a PR with your tests in the Contrib folder and I will include them so that
in the future I won´t break your solution with changes. And I'll make it pass if they are broken because of an issue.
I know the library needs ton more of tests, but resources here are limited. Sorry and thanks for your contribution!
